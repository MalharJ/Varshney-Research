# Varshney-Research
The code I wrote as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Prof. Lav Varshney.
There are three files here.
The main purpose of this project was to create graphs out of neuroscience articles and analyze the data. 
The file titled 'filtering_brain_structures.cpp' serves to mine and read 130,000 scientific articles and filter out certain words from each of them.
The file titled 'doublemap.cpp' serves to take each file produced by 'filtering_brain_structures.cpp' and generate an adjaceny matrix based on the frequency of pairs in each file.
